# JHU Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

This repository contains my submission for Data Science Specialization Capstone Project.

The submission comprise of the following files: 

1. DSS_Capstone.Rmd:  The source Rmarkdown file which processes the Yelp data, runs the models and generates the 5-page report.
2. DSS_Capstone-slides.Rpres:  The source Rpres file which generates the 5-slides presentation.
3. DSS_Capstone.pdf:  The generated 5-page report in PDF format.
4. DSS_Capstone-slides-rpubs.html:  the generated 5-slides published to Rpubs.

To reproduce the results, put the review and business json datasets from the 
Yelp Academic Dataset in the same working directory as the DSS_Capstone, and 
run knitr.
